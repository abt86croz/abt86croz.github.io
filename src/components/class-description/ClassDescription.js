        <p>
          Pilates is a system of controlled exercises that engage the mind and condition the whole
          body. The blend of strength and flexibility training improves posture, stabilization,
          functional movement, and core strength. Each exercise emphasizes breath, core
          conditioning, and body awareness with very close attention and awareness to alignment and
          form. Pilates focuses on a balanced approach so that no muscle group is overworked and the
          body moves as an efficient, holistic system. Pilates can be helpful for those healing from
          injury, rehabilitation, postpartum health, and is a wonderful compliment to any fitness
          regimen.
