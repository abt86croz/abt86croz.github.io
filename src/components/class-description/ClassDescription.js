          core strength. Each exercise emphasizes breath, core conditioning, and
          body awareness with very close attention and awareness to alignment
          and form. Pilates focuses on a balanced approach so that no muscle
          group is overworked and the body moves as an efficient, holistic
          system. Pilates can be helpful for those healing from injury,
          rehabilitation, postpartum health, and is a wonderful compliment to
          any fitness regimen.
